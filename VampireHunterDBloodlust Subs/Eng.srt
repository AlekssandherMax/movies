1
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,330
The distant future

2
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:15,310
Vampires rule the night, but their numbers are dwindling

3
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:25,320
With huge bounties on their heads, a class of hunters has emerged, Bounty Hunters

4
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,830
One hunter is unlike all the others He is a Dunpeal; a half human half vampire

5
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,380
At war with himself, feared by all, tortured and alone, he is

6
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,980
Here he comes!

7
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:07,000
Hail Mary, full of grace The Lord is with thee Blessed art thou among women Blessed is the Lord Jesus Christ

8
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,150
We've been expecting you

9
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,700
I'm Alan Elbourne, and I'm the one that summoned you here today for this reason

10
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,310
Go on I'm listening

11
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,030
It's about my sister, Charlotte

12
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,680
Two nights ago she disappeared

13
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,560
She was in bed, sleeping; it was the middle of the night

14
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,170
Several people told us they saw a carriage outside our house

15
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,020
The carriage

16
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,330
belonged to Meier Link, the vampire

17
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,070
I organized a search party of fifty men

18
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,920
but it was no use; we couldn't find them

19
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,890
We were ambushed

20
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,660
took my sister and killed my friends

21
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,490
That's just a down payment

22
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,320
You'll get the rest when you find her

23
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,050
Ten million dollars

24
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,500
But you better move fast

25
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,800
you've got some competition

26
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,880
I've hired the Markus Brothers

27
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,370
and they've got a head start on you

28
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,010
I don't think so

29
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,090
Huh?

30
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,940
It may be too late for her

31
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,520
Your sister may already have been tempted

32
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,290
What then?

33
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,130
You have to get there before that happens

34
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,550
what do you think we're paying you for?!

35
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,050
That's enough!

36
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,640
My son is emotional; please excuse him

37
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,470
This has been difficult for all of us

38
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,350
If you knew my daughter, you'd understand

39
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,010
she's kind and beautiful

40
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,600
and her loss is more than this old soul can bear

41
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,380
Now, I need to ask you something

42
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,600
if you find her changed, can you see that her death is without suffering

43
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,160
Be kind to her, please

44
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,220
No -no!

45
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,340
We can't do that; it isn't right

46
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,340
No! She won't be changed

47
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,110
you're talking about your daughter!

48
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,100
Alan, listen to me

49
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,580
It's not easy to ask him for this

50
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,560
but it's something that must be done

51
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,410
I'm sorry

52
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,600
Do you understand?

53
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,890
I understand your position, but

54
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,280
ten million dollars is not enough

55
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,160
What?

56
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
How dare you!

57
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,340
Stop it

58
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,620
hold your fire!

59
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,060
I said stop!

60
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,290
I'll double the price

61
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll give you twenty million

62
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,440
Just bring her back

63
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,790
one way or the other

64
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,680
Did you see a carriage go by here with four horses in front?

65
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,700
Let me go

66
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,070
let me go

67
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,850
le

68
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,600
You're lying

69
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,050
Oh, damn; we got company

70
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,290
Lotsa company

71
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,350
Look out!

72
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,990
Oh, man Is everybody OK?

73
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,860
Yeah

74
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,220
Do you believe that?

75
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,490
The place is overrun with them

76
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,630
He musta been here already

77
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,300
Well, c'mon

78
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,630
ready or not, here they come

79
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,590
It's zombie time

80
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,600
Yeah, come and get it, zombies!

81
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,650
Amen to that

82
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,700
Leila, are you there?

83
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,340
It won't take long, Grove

84
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,290
Juststay in the tank

85
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,220
Can't load!

86
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,820
Not so fast, buddy

87
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,660
And

88
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,100
fire!

89
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,430
Gotcha!

90
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,560
Rest in peace, huh?

91
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,570
You hear that?

92
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,890
Sounds like a horse

93
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,590
It's movinguphill

94
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,950
Let me try

95
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,180
Right

96
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,380
right about

97
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,340
right there!

98
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,800
Beautiful, just beautiful

99
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,590
I applaud you, stranger

100
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,330
Tell me what you're doing here

101
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,440
If we're in the same game, we should be friends

102
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,540
Tell me your name

103
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,700
Mine's Borgoff, Borgoff Markus

104
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,700
D

105
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,700
Ah, so that's the guy, the dhampir hunter

106
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,770
I've heard about him

107
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,700
He's amazing

108
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,000
Wake up, Borgoff, he's the competition, not some buddy of ours

109
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,980
C'mon, what are we doing here, we just helped him, think about it

110
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,410
Yeah, he's right, I agree with him about that

111
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,940
We help him too much and he'll take all the money

112
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,470
If it wasn't for us, he'd be dead by now

113
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,470
We do the work and he gets the reward

114
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,680
Ah, you boys should relax

115
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,070
We just did the famous dhampir a little favor is all

116
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,050
A little favor we can't afford

117
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,500
Hey

118
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,970
y'ever hear the one about the owl and squirrel?

119
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,710
Squirrel works all summer storin' away stuff for the winter, all kinds of nuts and seeds

120
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,070
works real hard

121
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,510
Then one day just before the first snow he goes outside for one last look around when

122
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,720
all of a sudden this owl swoops down and

123
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,260
grabs him, carries him off

124
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,280
"Ah, what a shame," says the squirrel

125
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,950
"'cause what's gonna happen to all that good food?"

126
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,190
Aw, that's a good one

127
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,950
Yeah, hilarious

128
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,800
You get it, you guys?

129
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,800
That stupid squirrel is all I can

130
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,350
Leila!

131
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,070
Hey, Leila, what's the rush?

132
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,870
What's with her?

133
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,150
So you're outnumbered, four to one; so what?

134
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,630
They do have a head start, but when the sun comes up, the heat will slow 'em down

135
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,830
Speaking of, ah, sun and heat, I know I don't need to remind you of your susceptibility

136
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,830
It's called heat syndrome

137
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,550
and the last time you ignored it, you almost

138
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,590
Don't worry

139
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,150
I hate it when you say that

140
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,110
Whatwhat are those ?

141
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,150
Tracks

142
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,430
let me see

143
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:53,430
Yes, OK! these are definitely that tracks, six hours old I'd say

144
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,470
OK

145
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,740
I'm suffocating now

146
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,560
Hey, how was that?

147
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,800
That's funny

148
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I could have sworn I heard something

149
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,600
Quiet

150
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Sand mantas, most likely

151
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,390
Sweet blasphemy, sand mantas galore!

152
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,910
Talk about your prehistoric pigeons

153
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,270
They're filthy animals, y'know, they're just filthy!

154
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,210
Well, I--I guess we better just turn back

155
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,640
it's a shame, really, 'cause you know, we could

156
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,360
No -go back, man

157
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,110
go back, now, c'mon

158
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,550
you're crazy

159
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,030
c'mon, man -please, let's' just go back

160
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,160
That -that was good

161
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
OK, now, we survived that, could we stop?

162
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,720
Diddid you ever hear the expression "too close for comfort"?

163
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,480
That--that was damn uncomfortable

164
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,800
What is it ? a resting house?

165
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,380
I didn't think anybody had those any more

166
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,640
They must be in there

167
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,120
Wow, it blends in nicely

168
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,170
OKoh, here we are

169
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,010
I -I see 'em

170
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,250
How many are there?

171
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,250
TwoI think

172
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,170
A man and a woman

173
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,610
Look out for the exit door

174
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,610
No door

175
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,650
no door there

176
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,930
still no door

177
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,450
no

178
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,640
Are you sure about that door ?

179
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,160
No no

180
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,400
What was that?

181
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,920
She's out of her mind!

182
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,360
Door! DOOR!

183
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,040
You're dead!

184
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,020
I'm here for the young woman

185
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,810
I wouldn't recommend it, dhampir

186
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,980
Taking on a vampire at night is a mission for morons and fools

187
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,920
which are you?

188
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,160
She's here by her own choice, dhampir

189
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,120
So unless you're the kind of man who would take a woman against her will for the money in it

190
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,000
and I'm sure it's a lot

191
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,800
I suggest you save your sorry ass now and leave us to travel in peace

192
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,760
I would if I could believe you, Meier

193
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,920
Your credibility, however, is less than impeccable under the circumstances

194
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
You kidnapped the girl

195
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,460
Meier!

196
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,260
Oh, my nose, my nose!

197
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,100
What happened ?

198
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,300
what'dwhat'd I miss?

199
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,660
She called out his name

200
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,540
It may be true, what he said

201
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,180
No, she's just ignorant

202
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,380
she's a child

203
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,580
She doesn't know him yet

204
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
She doesn't know what he's capable of

205
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,040
That poor girl

206
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,680
she'sshe's bleeding pretty bad

207
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,490
I mean, she won't last long

208
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,750
It's a shame

209
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,590
really -to waste all that good blood

210
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,470
I mean -come on, admit it -you're tempted

211
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,230
I mean, I know you are!

212
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,430
MMother

213
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,130
Wait, I was just kidding, y'know

214
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,850
C'mon, let's go

215
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,050
We got work to do

216
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,710
The money, c'mon; think of the money!

217
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,110
Hey, what did you do to me?

218
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,650
I bound your wound and stopped your bleeding That's all

219
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,110
Oh, I get it

220
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,780
You think you can just go ahead and tear off the clothes of whoever you come across

221
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,120
That's what you think, isn't it, DHAMPIR

222
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,760
You should go back home and nurse your wounds

223
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,160
What are you, my mother?

224
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,200
You called out for your mother before

225
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,620
I thought you might be needing her

226
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,500
Hey

227
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,060
I see her

228
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,910
When the last vampire is extinct, who will mourn our passing?

229
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,170
Will she? will anyone?

230
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,680
Can anyone understand this pain, this loneliness?

231
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,050
I told you so, didn't I?

232
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,550
I said, leave the girl alone

233
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,570
she's trouble

234
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,830
she's competition, y'know

235
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,270
YOU aided and abetted the enemy

236
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,250
I hope this is the right way

237
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,790
Trust me, I know how they think, these vampires:

238
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,090
when they're threatened, they all head for Barbarois

239
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,590
They're so predictable

240
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,850
Barbarois, yeah

241
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,610
And I really hate that place

242
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,730
It's full of lunatics and monsters, and that old crazy man, y'know

243
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,830
Does it hurt very much, Leila?

244
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,770
Leila?

245
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,010
Huh?

246
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,410
Your injurydoes it hurt you?

247
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,250
Oh, no, it's fine

248
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:51,850
I

249
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,550
Grove, you should lie down, you look tired

250
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,450
You need to restdon't worry about me

251
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,230
Leila

252
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,650
who dressed the wound? Was it him?

253
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,780
You can tell me

254
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,240
It was him, wasn't it? The dhampir hunter

255
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,420
Leila, I'm warning you

256
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,920
hehe's trouble He's against us

257
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,480
I don't know why he did that

258
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,320
Grove, please don't tell anyone, OK?

259
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,310
He stopped there

260
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:32,950
but what for?

261
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,830
Let's find out

262
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,890
Nolt and Kyle, you come with me

263
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,830
Leila, you stay in here with Grove

264
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,750
OKis everybody ready?

265
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,410
Always

266
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:42,810
Ready

267
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,310
Yeah

268
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,680
Hey, Nolt,  see what's goin' on in there, willya?

269
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,060
It may be a trap

270
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,880
Yeah, we'll cover you

271
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,020
It'll be my pleasure, gentlemen

272
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,880
It's nothin' but a lousy piece of cloth

273
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,640
What the hell ?

274
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,880
Bastardunbelievable!

275
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,260
Heywatch out!

276
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,170
So

277
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,650
you dare to enter Barbarois

278
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:15,580
I assume it's arrogance and vast stupidity that brings you here, gentlemen

279
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,840
or perhaps it's ignorance

280
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,880
You're skillful hunters, I can see

281
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,400
but you're no match for the Barbarois

282
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,490
Five thousand years of isolation have made us invincible!

283
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:42,690
Huh?

284
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,720
What?

285
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,500
What the hell's going on?

286
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,270
The shadow

287
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,790
watch out for the shadow

288
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,210
What're you talking about?

289
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,000
The shadowwhaddayou mean?

290
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,860
HeyNolt?

291
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,770
Hey, Nolt, what the hell happened to you, huh?

292
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,630
He'sHe's dead!

293
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,830
No, he's not!

294
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,150
Come on, Nolt

295
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,370
come on, snap out of it, come on

296
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,770
oh my God, damn it, come on!

297
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,890
I need you!

298
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,680
Oh GodNolt !

299
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,120
Oh, Godwe're getting close

300
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,760
Thoseare the windmills of the Barbarois

301
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,640
I really wish you'd turn back

302
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,320
There must be another way

303
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,900
There isn't

304
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,690
I am D, the hunter

305
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,950
I have business with the Barbarois

306
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,450
Oh, no

307
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,280
So I see you have dismounted

308
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,960
You have respect for your elders

309
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,980
That's very considerate indeed

310
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,200
I want you to stop your protection of Meier Link

311
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,860
You what?

312
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,320
You know, you make me laugh, that's a good one

313
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,480
I see you are a very humorous young man, and beautiful too, I might add

314
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,260
Or does that make you uncomfortable, to have an old lech like me admire you so?

315
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,180
Do you take me for a fool?

316
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,700
Someone paid me a hundred million dollars to protect Meier Link

317
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,640
Can you top that?

318
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,850
Well, you drive a hard bargain there, old man

319
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,470
what if I can?

320
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,590
You really are entertaining me, Mr Stranger!

321
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,170
I suppose you know our reputation

322
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,270
the Barbarois serve the people of the night,

323
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:04,430
and after five thousand years, I don't think we're about to change our stripes anytime soon,

324
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,870
although if we did for anyone it would be for you

325
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,220
I have seen many a dhampir,

326
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,940
but somebody like you I've never seen before

327
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,830
That's why it's such a pity that you have to die

328
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,130
I really can't let you leave here alive, now, can I?

329
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,830
I'm afraid you have to die, Stranger

330
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,090
So sorry

331
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,260
The Barbarois are great warriors

332
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,020
You are a warrior too, no doubt

333
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,620
and although you may kill some of us,

334
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,130
in the end we will prevail

335
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,840
I have sworn to protect the carriage

336
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,340
prepare to die!

337
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,360
Fool!

338
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,360
What's he doin' in there?

339
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,460
Borgoff, are we ready yet?

340
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,510
Grove

341
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,670
we have no choice

342
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,250
We need your help on this, Grove

343
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,030
Think you can do it there, man?

344
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,970
Give it to me

345
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,090
I'm waiting

346
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,370
Don't push yourself too hard, now

347
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,450
I mean it, OK

348
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,610
I want you back

349
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,470
You know, I really have nothing against the Barbarois personally

350
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,930
It's a shame I'll have to kill so many of you

351
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,850
Indeed, I admire your loyalty and your devotion to duty

352
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,410
Yet I wonder about the fairness when you allow one to fight against so many

353
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:32,250
But

354
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,910
if that will entertain you

355
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,790
I see

356
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,890
you make I see a good argument, young man

357
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,030
how interesting

358
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,910
Oh, man, I think the fellow is right

359
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,910
Please allow the three of us to entertain our young guest here,

360
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,630
unless he thinks that's unfair

361
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,210
three against one, how unfair, three against one, unfair

362
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,830
That's enough!

363
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,430
You mock us with your ridiculous antics, Benge

364
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,600
I will not have you distracting us from the job at hand, which is the protection of the carriage

365
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,980
We'll do things my wayhuh?

366
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,360
What the devil is that?

367
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,480
Go for it, Grovego for it!

368
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,530
Kill all those guys

369
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,730
kill every last one of 'em!

370
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,930
Come on, Grove, hold on

371
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,760
Get the carriage out now!

372
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,600
Follow me, Tinkerbell

373
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,620
I'm waiting for you!

374
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:36,730
Grove!

375
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,560
I've got to say this

376
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,170
I admire that young hunter's spirit,

377
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,430
although he doesn't stand a chance against Benge and the others

378
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,510
Still, it's a pity I'll miss the show

379
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,120
Oh well, c'est la vie

380
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,060
Wake up, D!

381
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
What's wrong with you?

382
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,130
It's not fair, it's not fair

383
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,770
I'll show you what's not fair!

384
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,530
Stay there till you rot, hunter!

385
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,300
Suckers!

386
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,360
Stop, I beg you

387
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,860
Say goodnight

388
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,680
Kyle, did you happen to see where that girl went?

389
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,520
Maybe she got caught in the wheels

390
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,620
Go look

391
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,280
Nice, Caroline, very nice

392
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,080
A little crude, but effective

393
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,760
They're all yours!

394
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,780
That freakin' monster

395
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,940
Is everybody all right?

396
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,760
Yeah, but Kyle was outside

397
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,700
He was up on top

398
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,610
Kyle?

399
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,930
Kyle, where the hell are you, Kyle?

400
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:20,930
Down here!

401
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,270
You OK?

402
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,130
Quiet! They're still around!

403
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,600
No!

404
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,280
Damn! That idiot!

405
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,460
Well, how convenient this is for me

406
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,020
Come on out here so I can finish the job

407
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,020
Your time is up

408
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,640
Come on, you coward!

409
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,120
You're gonna pay for the pain you caused my brother

410
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,770
D! Are you awake?

411
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,290
I need your help to swallow up this spell

412
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,950
You're a slave driver, you know that?

413
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,660
Hey, remember to watch out for the shadow, huh?

414
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,180
Try and stay still

415
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,040
Easier said than done

416
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,480
And keep your mouth shut

417
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,870
That was close

418
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,570
Well, the tank is fulla holes

419
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,510
Fuel's all gone, we can't drive it like this anyway

420
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,590
What're we gonna do?

421
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,510
What Should We Do?

422
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,510
Borgoff, any idea?

423
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:45,850
How's Grove?

424
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,030
Honestly, not too great

425
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,350
Borgoff, wake up!

426
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,850
What are you thinking about over there?

427
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,170
Oh, nothin', really

428
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,990
I was just thinkin' about the carriage

429
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,630
Wonder where it is by now

430
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,630
Well, man, at this point it's pretty much anybody's guess

431
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:07,130
If you want my opinion, I'd say they're either setting sail from the port of Abrol or hiding somewhere deep in the Grenerge Mountain Range

432
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,130
I sure hope so

433
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,530
Anyway, we still have to get some fuel

434
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,700
and the town of Garucia isn't that far away from here

435
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,820
Kyle, you go with Leila

436
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,300
I'll stay here and do the repairs

437
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,840
If you are seeking the pathway to the stars, come to me

438
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,900
I pray for your safe arrival with all my heart

439
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,870
The pathway to the stars

440
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,960
I dunno about you, but y'know, I sure miss that horse

441
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,800
What was his name?

442
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,740
Ohoh, the silent treatment, huh?

443
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,320
Well, I got two words for you: Heat syndrome

444
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,700
Look -look, I know I'm a parasite, but haven't I always been a helpful parasite?

445
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,600
You may not care if you die from heat

446
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,920
but becoming a piece of beef jerky is not a lifelong ambition of mine

447
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,610
Yeah, well, what's the sound of one hand yapping

448
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,430
How much?

449
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,110
Oh no -keep your money

450
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,990
C'mon, just take it --

451
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,410
Let's go

452
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,690
Leila?

453
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,850
Oh I see

454
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,110
It's him, isn't it?

455
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,600
Kyle, why don't you start back without me

456
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,720
There's something I want to do here first

457
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,460
Back off

458
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,060
Have I told you

459
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,950
you're quite irresistible in that sexy skin-tight getup?

460
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,190
No -tell me about it

461
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,110
I just did

462
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,370
Make sure you watch your back with that guy, Leila

463
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,520
I'd like a beer

464
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,050
I've just been admirin' your fancy weapon there

465
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,650
Don't worry

466
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,070
I have no plans to use it anytime soon

467
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,450
That's good

468
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:05,350
That's good, 'cause I have no plans to let you keep it

469
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,090
Give it up

470
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,500
You heard me, little girl

471
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,870
Mm Thank you

472
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,410
Well, here's to ya, Sheriff

473
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,230
I'd buy you a drink, but

474
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,120
Thank you, but no thanks

475
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:36,090
Oh, OK I was just gonna say, you must be awfully busy with that new dhampir hunter in the town now

476
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,390
What dhampir hunter?

477
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,800
I'd like to buy that horse

478
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,090
Three hundred thousand dollars

479
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,960
And if you don't like the price, go somewhere else

480
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,530
Freeze! Put your hands where I can see 'em Now!

481
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,260
Sheriff, he paid good money for that

482
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:29,840
What are you doing?!

483
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,670
Take your money and go

484
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,100
We don't want you here

485
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,670
We don't sell to dhampirs in this town, understand?

486
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,110
Understand me, dhampir?

487
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,860
You understand

488
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,150
Wait a minute That's my horse you're talking about there,

489
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:53,160
and I'll sell it to whoever I want if they can afford the price I'm asking

490
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,050
You can't do that

491
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,830
We have laws against it, Polkgood laws, and for a damn good reason

492
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,240
What laws?

493
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,390
Don't play coy, Polk, you know as well as I dhampirs aren't allowed

494
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,470
Not allowed, right

495
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,010
I remember a time not that long ago when we had vampires and dhampirs both around here But

496
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,410
And that's why we have the law

497
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:19,350
Listen to me, whether you want to hear it or notyou weren't even born when this happened

498
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,810
Do yourself a favor and listen to the story

499
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,740
I'm going to tell you about the time when the children were kidnapped

500
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,120
There were ten children altogether

501
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,340
Yeah, I heard about that time

502
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,320
The kidnappers turned out to be vampires, of course

503
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,820
And so the townspeople pooled their money to hire a vampire hunter

504
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,420
They wanted the best

505
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,970
And when the hunter came

506
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,340
he was a very strong and quiet man

507
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,300
and he did his job, too, which was to return the children safely back into their parents' homes

508
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:57,200
It wasn't easy, but many vampires died by his hands before this job was over with

509
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,290
And when it was over and the children were back home,

510
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,990
the people attacked the man

511
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,550
They said he was a dhampir, half vampire himselfso they punished him

512
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,720
Can't say I blame them for doing that

513
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,160
You can't trust 'em, that's all that's about

514
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,160
They were right about that part, Polk

515
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,880
He did the job!

516
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,030
I see then, I'll have to take matters into my own hands

517
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,410
Let him go

518
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,560
What is that?

519
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,870
What does it look like, idiot?

520
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:28,900
Put down your guns

521
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,080
Polk, you can't know what you're doing put it down

522
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
I know exactly what I'm doing

523
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,460
You DON'T know! Put it down now, you old fool!

524
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,100
I would much rather be an old fool than what you are, Sheriff

525
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,020
Now, don't shoot

526
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,430
I can tell you I won't think twice about using this weapon

527
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,440
I might even enjoy it

528
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,320
Get on your horse, Stranger

529
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,470
Thank you

530
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,440
No, it's only fitting I thank you

531
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,190
It's the least I can do

532
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,790
I may be just an old fool now, Stranger,  but I could never forget a face like yours

533
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,750
And I'll never forget what you done for me back then

534
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,820
That's rightI was one of them kids

535
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,900
And I always felt bad about that

536
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,040
the way you was treated

537
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,230
How nobody stopped you, nobody thanked you instead the ignorant bastards ran you right out of our town

538
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,100
So it's true, isn't it, what they say about you dhampirs

539
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,110
You don't age

540
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,730
Now goI'm getting tired

541
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,180
Where's Benge? What's taking him so long?

542
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:07,710
Well, the horses are rested now We'd better go

543
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,210
Come on

544
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,600
Master, what is it? May I help you, sir?

545
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,910
It's still light outside, Master!

546
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:23,790
What?

547
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,290
Leave her alone, Mashira

548
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,720
Yes, sir

549
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,960
She misses the sunlight Let her enjoy it

550
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,880
I am D, the hunter

551
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,820
Your father sent me

552
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,200
Don't be afraidI won't hurt you

553
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,140
You sit in the sunlightyou must not be changed

554
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,140
So why do you stay with him?

555
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,430
Last night in the carriage you called out his name

556
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,970
Why did you call for him?

557
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,290
I suppose my father has not told you that I'm in love with Meier

558
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,650
You don't know who he is

559
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,650
You can't be in love with him

560
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,690
Well, I am

561
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,840
If you only knew how good he's been to me

562
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,840
I love him

563
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,100
Please believe me; no one else will

564
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,100
You don't understand

565
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,320
He is what he is, Charlotte

566
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,360
You can't change him; he'll take you in time

567
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,300
And when that happens, I will have to kill you

568
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,420
Fine; kill me, then

569
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,460
I would rather die than to go anywhere without him

570
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,940
Don't take me back thereI mean it I simply could not live without Meier

571
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,190
How sweet that is

572
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,780
She loves a vampire

573
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:29,990
So very sweet

574
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,330
Idiot!

575
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,120
You stupid girl, get up! We're going

576
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,490
Leave me alone!

577
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,020
You'll do what I say

578
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:46,170
Do you have any idea how many people have died at the hands of your beloved Meier, this vampire you wanna protect!

579
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:46,170
None!

580
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:52,150
You fool! And youYou stay right where you are, my friend

581
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,120
Sorry, but I really don't want to have to share any of my profits

582
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,660
You understand, don't youit's business

583
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:08,600
Above you

584
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,030
What's wrong? Tell me!

585
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,920
Too much sun

586
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,670
I warned you about the heat, but you don't listen!

587
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,150
Come on You can't survive unless you dig a hole You need to bury yourself!

588
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,990
Hurry!

589
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:40,950
Leila! Leila, are you there? Come in, Leila

590
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,450
Yeah, I copy

591
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,590
Thank God Are you OK? What's your position?

592
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:49,380
I'm near Lake Chiffon Our game is heading north from here

593
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,790
We'll catch up

594
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,030
Leila, do you know what's happened to the dhampir hunter?

595
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,880
No; I haven't seen him

596
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,630
All right Well, take care

597
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,740
Stay in touch Borgoff out

598
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,310
The tables have turned

599
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,640
Now, that cleared my head

600
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,630
I really should return the favor, don't you think, honey?

601
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,010
Don't get any ideas

602
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,020
Hey, I'm just trying to stay dry here

603
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,980
If there was any other place to go, believe me, I'd be there

604
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,890
As soon as the rain lets up, I'll be gone from here and from you

605
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,670
I think I can guess your problem

606
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:16,120
Your family was the victim of vampires

607
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,130
You don't know what you're talking about

608
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,790
You don't know anything about it

609
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,210
All right Perhaps I don't

610
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,550
This stupid thingit bothers me

611
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,280
You really are a weird one, you know that?

612
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:37,630
In spite of being a dhampir hunter and all that that entails

613
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,390
How did you know about my mother?

614
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,650
You called her name, remember?

615
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,500
She was kidnapped by vampires

616
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:50,100
My father went after her and was trying to rescue her so they killed him

617
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,850
And after a while my mother returned, but she wasn't my mother any more

618
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,410
she'd been changed

619
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:00,020
The people in the village stoned her to death while I watched

620
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,670
After that I left home

621
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,330
I met the Markus brothers and joined with them

622
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,710
I wanted to be a hunter to avenge my parents' deaths

623
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:13,930
I've seen many terrible things since then, lives destroyed, families devastated, hopes crushed

624
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,250
every time, it seems vampire is to blame

625
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,710
I can understand why you'd choose to do it, but the life of a hunter is no kind of life

626
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,910
It's the only life I'm any good for now, and it looks like it's the only life you've ever known

627
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,450
So I suggest we make a pact

628
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:38,450
Since we're both in it for the long haul, whoever dies first, the other one can come and bring flowers to their grave

629
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,100
How's that?

630
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,520
It's the rain

631
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,790
makes me sentimental

632
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,350
I don't know why I should care about thatit's just I love flowers

633
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,360
And I don't think I'll be getting any

634
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,120
I'm all alone, after all

635
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,720
We have that much in common, don't we

636
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,720
That we're both hunters and we're both alone

637
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,120
Oh well, I'm being sillydoesn't really matter

638
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:01,770
I'll do it

639
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,480
I'll bring you flowers if I survive thisbut I don't expect to

640
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:09,990
Stop, I didn't really mean it when I said that

641
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,940
And anyway, I don't really understand why you should keep on doing this

642
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,180
Because I'm a dhampir

643
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,710
I don't get to have a life; not like you

644
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,930
Well, with the rainstorm last night, they can't be too far away

645
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,180
We're even now, dhampirunderstand?

646
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:15,470
I have a very bad feeling about this

647
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,640
How so?

648
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:19,970
I think I've finally figured it out, Borgoff

649
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,760
Well, I'm sure you're rightif you're thinking they're headed for the castle

650
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,720
Yeah, that's right, the castlethe Castle of Chaythe!

651
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:34,570
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, WE CAN'T GO IN THERE, IT WOULD BE SUICIDE!

652
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,320
What are you now, afraid of a little insanity?

653
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,840
Since when have we been sane?

654
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,800
We just have to get to them before they reach the castle

655
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:47,550
There's a bridge up aheadthat's where we intercept the carriage

656
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:51,780
I remember that trick from the time we got those vampires at Keldo

657
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,110
Yeah, it worked that time, and it can work again now

658
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,190
Leila, come in; come in, Leila Over

659
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,790
Yeah it's me, I copy

660
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,060
What's up?

661
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,710
I'm on my way

662
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,070
Don't move

663
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:42,450
I'm warning youtry anything funny and you'll be blown to smithereens

664
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:44,940
You wanna try it?

665
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,200
I didn't think so

666
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,650
We just want the girl

667
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,510
Hello there!

668
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,560
She's still human!

669
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,960
Come on, get out of there NOW!

670
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,500
Borgoff, she won't come

671
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,460
We're doing you a favor!

672
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:20,020
Come ON, I said get outta there!

673
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:33,610
Let that be a lesson to ya, you cowardly Barbarois animal

674
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,720
Borgoff, look

675
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:35,990
Borgoff!

676
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,760
What? What the --?

677
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,970
What, is this guy crazy?

678
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,050
Doesn't he know he can't exist outside here in the sunlight?

679
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,570
I won't let you take her!

680
00:59:58,820 --> 00:59:59,800
Oh, yeah?

681
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,990
Thanks a lotyou're making our job a lot easier

682
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,350
Hot enough for ya?

683
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:09,830
What you deserve!

684
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,990
Over here, hot stuff!

685
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,140
Oohoo, lookit him burn!

686
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,370
No!

687
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,650
What the hell do you want

688
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,060
How's that feelmoron!

689
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:45,130
lookit him!

690
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,380
Hey, where do you think!

691
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,490
Why'd you let her go!

692
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,290
I love you

693
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,260
I can't go on without you

694
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,360
What?

695
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,930
Borgoff, we should just let her kill herself

696
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:40,180
and then we can finish him off, what do you think about that idea?

697
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,820
We get the money if she's dead or alive

698
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,720
Hey, you're rightOK

699
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,300
Stop it!

700
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,580
Kyle!

701
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,790
I'll blow you to hell!

702
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,080
What!

703
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:38,700
I don't want you to worry about these wounds of mine

704
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,290
They will heal

705
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,410
Then we shall go to the city of night and distant stars

706
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,170
When we go there we can be alone and free to love each other

707
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:56,180
It's true, believe me; we'll be there soon

708
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:46,840
We're it now; we're the only ones left, Borgoff; we should just give it up

709
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:53,710
If we make it into that castle, none of us will make it out alive

710
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,480
We CAN'T quit now

711
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,590
We owe it to Kyle and to Nolt to keep going on

712
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:03,620
Listen, Borgoff

713
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,300
Shaddup! I won't hear it

714
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,190
Leilawhat do you think?

715
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,780
Grove, they fear us

716
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:19,460
They fear us because they know our reputation That we never give up

717
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,100
And we never can

718
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,370
If we quit now, we might as well quit the business, and I can't do that

719
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,910
I won't do ittill every last one of them is gone

720
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,740
Masterdo you hear?

721
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:53,880
He is coming

722
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,980
The castle is nearby

723
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,500
I'll stay here and deal with him

724
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,020
Getting close The Castle of Chaythe

725
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,900
Soon we'll be able to see it

726
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,680
the home of Carmila, the Bloody Countess

727
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:33,340
You've heard of her

728
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:38,210
For five thousand years her rule of terror lasted, and then, that was that!

729
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,840
Your father, the vampire king, grew angry

730
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:52,240
He was impatient with her vanity; offended by her bloodlust, her gluttony

731
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:59,670
He grew so tired that he killed her while she slept, impaling her on a sword, and that was it for her

732
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:06,540
Except she haunts the place now with phantoms and demons, but you don't care about that, do you?

733
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,750
But I bet I know what really gets to you, dhampir

734
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,500
what REALLY gets to you

735
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:17,390
the thought of those two lovebirds giving birth to another dhampir, huh?

736
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,170
That's it

737
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:26,570
You see, I know you; I know how you think, I know how you feel, I know every move that you make, you can't

738
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:40,500
I'm glad we could meet at last, Hunter D

739
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,260
You are a worthy opponent

740
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,160
Who hired the Barbarois?

741
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,180
Who were you working for?

742
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:52,700
It was Carmila who hired us

743
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:55,290
And as a Barbarois, my duty has been fulfilled

744
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,920
Now I can die in peace

745
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,820
I gather from your letter that you had a rather difficult time

746
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,960
I think I can understand what it's like

747
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,340
Love is not unique to humans, you know

748
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,720
we vampires are very susceptible

749
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,720
I hope I can be of service

750
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:19,970
We're very grateful, Carmila

751
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,630
You both must be exhausted

752
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,400
Perhaps you should rest first

753
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,990
I'm sure that the young lady would like to freshen up

754
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:46,340
You've probably heard rumors about me, but I can assure you, they all stem from jealousy and envy

755
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,460
I'm not the "Bloody Carmila" they like to portray me as

756
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,720
Now, behold

757
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,970
That's it; that is the ship

758
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:08,830
It will take you to the city of the night where you can live peacefully at last

759
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,170
You can be happy there

760
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:20,570
There was a time, many years ago, when every castle had a ship like this one and the night sky was full of their flashing lights

761
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:27,600
Those were the days when vampires flourished and a love like yours was not so desperately impossible

762
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,430
So different from today

763
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:36,760
Our numbers dwindling, hunted and alone, we're hopelessly misunderstood

764
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:42,170
but you two seem to have beaten the odds

765
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:46,440
I'm very very happy for you

766
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,470
The ship hasn't been used in years

767
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,320
I've no idea if it will fly safely, but I'm sure that's a risk you're prepared to take

768
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,950
We're very grateful

769
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,950
I only wish I could go with you

770
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,840
You look so beautiful

771
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:48,370
Why stop? I want you, Meier I want all of you

772
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:53,760
Why not?

773
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:57,000
You don't know what it's like, Charlotte

774
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:05,620
to live forever in darkness eternal, forever thirsting for blood despite your best intention

775
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,850
I can't imagine that life for you; not for you, Charlotte

776
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,740
You're so selfish, Meier

777
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:17,120
I carry a heavy weight on my conscience

778
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:23,880
Those villagers and the bounty hunter and my familythey still mourn my loss, Meier

779
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,630
It wasn't your doing, Charlotte

780
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,140
It was my fault entirely

781
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,560
Well, then we're both to blame, because we can't know happiness; not anymore

782
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:39,800
I wanted you to be happy, Meier, and so I abandoned my father and my brother for you

783
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:44,940
But their pain set the wheels in motion for our pain, and so on and on it goes

784
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:51,260
All we have is each other now, and I want to be close to you

785
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,930
Without that we have nothing

786
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,380
All the pain I've caused and all the agony I feel is nothing now!

787
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:05,050
And you are everything to me, my love

788
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:19,080
We'll talk more on our trip to the stars, if that's all right with you

789
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:26,510
There is some unfinished business I have to attend to

790
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,090
Do not leave this room, understand?

791
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:09,700
D

792
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:25,270
Listen, Meier The woman says she wants to go back home

793
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,550
I don't believe it

794
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:00,560
Charlotte

795
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:16,290
I dunno, something's not right

796
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,750
'Course, ah, you don't have to take my word for it

797
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:24,360
you can judge for yourself

798
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:57,010
Let's go!

799
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,900
Leila, don't go

800
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:05,060
Leila, don't go in there

801
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:08,020
If you go in there, you're never coming back!

802
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,160
Oh, I'm coming back

803
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:12,870
No!

804
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,170
Leila, check upstairs

805
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,280
I'm on it

806
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:41,250
Nice hat

807
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,020
I know you hate me, D

808
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,810
Please try and understand

809
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,060
I loved your father

810
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:37,330
What choice did I have?

811
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,180
Nolt, Kyle

812
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:06,550
hey, I don't believe it!

813
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,630
You two sure are a sight for sore eyes!

814
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:39,260
What are you doing? Get up!

815
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,920
Why aren't you listeningI said get up!

816
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,360
Go away

817
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,090
Get out of here!

818
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,330
Can you forgive me, D?

819
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:07,460
D?

820
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,580
I know it's been lonely for you

821
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:13,500
I was lonely too

822
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,880
until you came along

823
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:18,470
Did you hear? D?

824
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:30,290
It's OK, honey

825
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,170
it's OK to cry

826
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,760
I know I know how you feel

827
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:39,190
It wasn't your fault It wasn't

828
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,660
Yes it was!

829
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,630
Let go!

830
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,430
It's just an illusion

831
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,600
Carmila's playing with us

832
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,530
Excellentwhat fun!

833
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:07,230
I haven't had this much fun in centuries!

834
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:08,870
You don't mind, do you?

835
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:11,700
It just makes things so much more interesting

836
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:15,650
You're doing very well, by the way very well indeed

837
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,890
The womanwhere are you hiding her?

838
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,580
Borgoffwhat are you doing! We don't have time for this!

839
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,860
Leila -are you in love with this dhampir?

840
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,080
Are you crazy? What is wrong with you

841
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,000
Borgoff!

842
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,220
Dhampir

843
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,230
drop your weapon

844
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,590
Drop it now!

845
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,890
She took you in, didn't she?

846
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:13,360
She'll die! I'm warning you, dhampir, don't come any closer

847
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,580
Enough! Now you die

848
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:28,720
Grove!

849
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:31,140
Grove, no!

850
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,550
Lei la

851
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:43,460
Lookshe's comingCarmila

852
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,480
The spirit of Carmila!

853
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:33,700
Dhampir hunteryour mother was human, but your father was a vampire, and you're betraying his ancient blood

854
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:36,770
You side with humans against us

855
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:44,860
Your people are facing extinction, and you're contributing to their demise

856
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,210
You stalk and kill your own ancestors, dhampir

857
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:54,840
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!

858
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:58,490
Your human self is your weaker self

859
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:00,380
Humans are nothing more than livestock

860
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,640
We prey on them as they prey on beasts

861
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,650
This is the rule of nature!

862
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:19,790
Your time is coming to an end

863
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,460
Your kind must face extinction

864
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,480
You cannot survive; you must die

865
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,710
That is the rule of nature

866
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,530
Ahvery strong words for a dhampir

867
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:37,360
But you seem to forgetour spirits are eternal

868
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:41,170
No, Carmila; nothing lasts forever

869
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:44,580
I see

870
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:49,150
I should have known better than to reason with your kind, dhampir hunter

871
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,190
I guess my only option is to use force

872
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:32,700
Nothis can't happen!

873
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:00,610
Are you the son of the vampire king?

874
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:04,060
Who are you? Who are you, dhampir?

875
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:10,390
Such power!

876
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:43,460
Charlotte, come back I need you; please come back

877
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,480
Darling, is that you?

878
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,280
Oh yes It's meMeier

879
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:04,190
I'm so happy, Meier, because we are together now At last

880
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,570
Together At last

881
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,750
You made me happy, Meier

882
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:16,250
You let me dream You let me dream of our beautiful trip to the stars

883
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:17,530
Our dream

884
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:21,020
Our beautiful, wonderful dream

885
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,370
It's not a dream We are going to those stars, Charlotte

886
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:27,920
Oh, my dear one

887
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:31,780
You and I will get away from here

888
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:36,820
We will fly together to the city of the night where we were meant to be free from all of this

889
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:39,980
where you can rest, my love, finally, and be free

890
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:45,040
Yesfreedom! At last

891
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,210
My precious, precious love

892
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:10,610
Let's goaway from here

893
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,080
Stop right there, Meier

894
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:26,710
I'm taking her backback to her family who loved her

895
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:35,900
She knew I loved her best of all

896
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,660
You can't understand it You've never loved a human

897
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:42,680
I've never killed one, either

898
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:49,110
You struggle to resist this nature of ours, but it can't last forever, D

899
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:52,730
The urge for their blood is stronger

900
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,810
If that day comes, then another will hunt me

901
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,570
It's as simple as that

902
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:35,290
What a waste What a sad waste

903
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:13,100
Enough of killing Enough of misery and death

904
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,010
I've had enough

905
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:38,330
I've had enough!

906
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:11,380
Why did you miss my heart?

907
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:29,110
She's dead The ring is all I need

908
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:31,290
I'll take it to her father

909
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,290
As proof

910
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,110
Mind giving me a ride just as far as the next town?

911
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:51,830
I'd appreciate it

912
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:58,970
That reward money would rightfully be mine, y'know

913
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:01,170
But hey, I'm generous

914
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,800
I'll let you keep it just this one time

915
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,690
Where is he taking her?

916
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:45,560
Away from here

917
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:47,810
Away

918
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:57,420

919
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,590

920
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,420

921
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,200
Fly away

922
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:12,170
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in this resting place to bid farewell to our sister

923
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,930
Into your gentle arms we commend her gracious spirit

924
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:22,130
Take her to yourself and give her safe haven

925
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:27,600
And though she struggled in life, now she knows your blessed peace

926
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,350
For all who question will find answers,

927
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:37,880
and all who love will find contentment, joy, and peace eternal

928
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:41,940
For now we see as through a glass darkly,

929
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,030
but then we shall see clearly, face to face

930
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:53,180

931
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:54,940

I just came here to keep a promise to an old friend of mine

941
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:40,180
She was afraid no one would mourn her death

942
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,180
I'm glad she was so wrong

943
01:35:42,730 --> 01:35:43,100
