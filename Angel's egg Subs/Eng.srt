1
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,245
Who?

2
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,416
Who are you?

3
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:55,097
Angel's Egg.

4
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,897
Keep precious things inside you...

5
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,316
...or you will lose them.

6
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,987
What do you think is
inside that egg?

7
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,118
I can't tell you things like that.

8
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,830
Besides, I don't even know
who you are.

9
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:05,087
You have to break an egg
if you are to know what is inside.

10
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,007
Who are you?

11
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,385
Don't follow mel.

12
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,693
The fish have come out.

13
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,530
Fish?

14
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:51,057
Even though the fish
are not anywhere...

15
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,875
...still they chase after them.

16
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,707
Please...

17
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,000
...my egg...

18
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,169
...don't do anything to it.

19
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,507
This way.

20
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:09,287
I've seen a tree
like this somewhere.

21
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,708
Where was it?

22
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,338
So long ago that I've forgotten.

23
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,967
Somewhere under a sky where the clouds
made sounds as they moved.

24
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:31,476
The black horizon swelled
and from it grew a huge tree.

25
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,872
It sucked the life
from the ground

26
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,458
and its pulsing branches
reached up,

27
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,442
as if to grasp something.

28
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:46,783
The giant bird sleeping
within an egg.

29
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,160
What happened to the bird?

30
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,079
Where is it?

31
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:04,008
It's still there now,
still dreaming.

32
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,717
Dreaming?

33
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,388
What kind of dream
does the bird dream?

34
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,743
What is in the egg?

35
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,853
You still cannot tell me?

36
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,993
Since when have you
been here?

37
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,584
As many days as there
are bottles?

38
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,093
I too have forgotten
where I'm from.

39
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,807
And maybe, I didn't know from
the beginning where I am going.

40
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,936
Will you be going away?

41
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:44,669
I will wipe from the earth man
whom I have created...

42
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:50,883
...man and beast, crawling creature
and bird of the air as well...

43
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:55,179
...for I regret that I made them.

44
00:41:55,763 --> 00:42:00,953
I will send rain on the earth
for forty days and forty nights...

45
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:05,356
...and I will wipe from the ground
every living thing I have made.

46
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,699
And after seven days the waters
of the flood came upon the earth.

47
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,598
On that very day all the fountains
of the great deep burst forth...

48
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,308
...and the floodgates of
the heavens were opened.

49
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,812
And rain fell on the earth
forty days and forty nights.

50
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,589
But the ark floated on
the surface of the waters.

51
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,693
All flesh that moved on
the earth died...

52
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:39,974
...birds, cattle, wild animals, all creatures
that creep on the earth, and all men.

53
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:46,814
Only Noah and those with him
in the ark were left.

54
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:53,196
Then he sent a dove to see if the waters
had abated from the surface of the ground.

55
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:09,087
Then he waited another seven days, and
again sent forth the dove from the ark...

56
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,049
...but she did not return
to him any more.

57
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,362
Where did the bird land?

58
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,282
Or maybe it weakened
and was swallowed by the waters.

59
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,058
No one could know.

60
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:26,038
So the people waited
for her return.

61
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,457
Waited and grew tired of waiting.

62
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:32,711
They forgot they had released the bird;
Forgot there was a bird.

63
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,488
They even forgot there was
a world sunken under water.

64
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:44,455
They forgot where they were from; How long
they traveled; And where they were going.

65
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,836
It was so long ago that
the animals have turned to stone.

66
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:59,137
The bird I saw, I can't even remember
where or when, it was so long ago.

67
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,889
Perhaps it was a dream.

68
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:10,189
Maybe you and I and the fish exist only in
the memory of a person who is gone.

69
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,694
Maybe no one really exists
and it is only raining outside.

70
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,198
Maybe the bird never existed at all.

71
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,414
It exists.

72
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,296
It's here.

73
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,342
It's here.

74
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,058
It's here.

75
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:17,584
I found it, it's already
turned to stone, it's in here.

76
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,945
I'm going to hatch it and put it back.

77
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,364
It's the bird I found.

78
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,036
I know that.

79
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,042
I thought so.

80
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,511
Can you hear something?

81
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:43,986
I can hear it.

82
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,156
The sound of soft breathing.

83
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,076
That's your breathing.

84
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,453
I can hear the sound of wings.

85
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,392
It must be dreaming of flying in the sky.

86
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,685
That's just the sound of
the wind outside.

87
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,062
Very soon. That's just the
sound of the wind outside.

88
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,296
Very soon.

89
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:08,636
Right now you're in here dreaming,
but soon I will show you.

90
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,596
Very soon.

91
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,434
So you must stay here for now.

92
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,688
Here it doesn't rain...

93
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,359
Here it is warm.

94
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,435
Who are you?

95
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,061
Who are you?

96
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:33,996
Who?

97
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,876
Who are you?
